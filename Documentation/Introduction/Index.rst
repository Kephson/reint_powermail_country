What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides a better ViewHelper for the powermail country field.
It uses the static_info_tables(_iso2) extensions for the countries (like it is done in powermail).

Following is done:

- Sorting is done with the name of the country 
- Additional option "other country" will be added
- support for older static_info_tables extensions



Support for the following domain model extensions:

- `static_info_tables <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables>`_
- `static_info_tables_de <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables_de>`_
- `static_info_tables_fr <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables_fr>`_



It supports also the old "outdated" static_info_tables extensions without domain model:

- `static_info_tables_ru <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables_ru>`_
- `static_info_tables_sv <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables_sv>`_
- `static_info_tables_nl <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables_nl>`_
- `static_info_tables_it <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables_it>`_
- `static_info_tables_es <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables_es>`_
- `static_info_tables_da <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables_da>`_
